 If your system is broken and and an error like
 
"Unknown column 'MyProfile_identifier' in 'field list'
SELECT id AS "id",timestamp AS "timestamp",MyProfile_identifier AS "identifier"..."

is shown on your page your config file is broken.

That is no problem. Just edit the config/tabledef.inc and make it empty. Just delete all content!

Then your site will run again. But now, it is very very important to to these steps as soon as possible:

- go to the MyProfile configuration
  + edit a data field of your choice
  + do not change anything, just save / update the field 
  
=> Your system will run again without problems because the tabledef.inc is rewritten by updating a data field!
