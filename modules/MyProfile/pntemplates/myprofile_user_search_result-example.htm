This is a custom template.
You can enter this file's name 
(myprofile_user_search_result-example.htm) 
in admin backend of the MyProfile module 
and you can use all these variables:

<!--[$user|@prayer]-->

But you should take care if every user is 
allowed to access these data... Also guests
might do a little search on your site.

Have a lot of fun!
