Features: MyProfile 1.0

added (if you have used pnProfile before)
=====
+ Password management and email adress management. If you use MyProfile you
  have to deactive / overwrite (attention: "Profile" is called a core module
  and cannot be deactivated by hand, so it is neccesarry to overwrite the module)
  the regular profile module. So you'll loose the passwort and email address 
  management. But don't panic. MyProfile brings a great management for the
  email addresses: New email adresses will only be taken as valid address after
  a confirmation.
+ live check for updates

removed (if you have used pnProfile before)
=======
- copy field's value into another table / column. I do not think that we need
  this feature any more. The MyProfile module is a full usable profile module.
  So choose: Use MyProfile or the regular Profile as profile module...
- functional accounts: This feature was not reimplemented. If you really need
  this feasture write a feature request in the NOC.

*******************************************************************************
* The pnProfile module will not be supported any more. Now,                   *
* pnProfile moved to MyProfile, the advanced Profile module for PostNuke .8   *

  redirected to his profile page so he can see the 
  result of his changes directly after storing the data
- added: "pnClickedMe visits per day averge"
  pnClickedMe > 0.30 can now calculate how often a
  profile is visited per day (7 day average value)
  This is integrated in the generic profile template 
  now. Make sure IF pnClickedMe is installed that it
  is up to date. Otherwise you will get an error.

new in 0.40:
============
- Version 0.30 was broken - 0.40 corrects the prefix
  and makes sure that this prefix is created the way
  it should be created.
  The prefix was changed from pnProfile_ to _
  So a field called name will be _name in the DB.

new in 0.30:
============
- new identifiers will get a prefix "pnprofile_" 
  because otherwise the identifiers like "name" 
  might cause errors because such variables 
  are used in the core and have side effects 
  in pnProfile
- English language file is now included in the release
- Fixed bug in the manual

new in 0.20:
