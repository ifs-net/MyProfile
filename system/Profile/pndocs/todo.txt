var:global?:timezoneoffset
inc:img:images/avatar
inc:lang:_FIELDCONSTANT
     |
     |
     |
     |
     |
	 V

root/language/xxx/_FIELDCONSTANT.php ?
     |
     |
     |
     |
     |
	 V

<?php

if (isset($_FIELDCONSTANT_OPTIONS)) unset($_FIELDCONSTANT_OPTIONS);

$_FIELDCONSTANT_OPTIONS = array();

$_FIELDCONSTANT_OPTIONS[] = "X";
$_FIELDCONSTANT_OPTIONS[] = "Y";
$_FIELDCONSTANT_OPTIONS[] = "Z";

?>

OR............. something similar, to be discussed as the select will have a multilingual issue in the future.

---------------------------------------------
Add check "required"

Test different fields type

Add "multiple" feature to select
+
plugin to show information of the select including separator param ("<br />", ", ")
or...

something similar.


Later :

Group fields

Either using a different type in prop_dtype where more than one field can be merge to one field...

Example : _DAYBIRTH _MONTHBIRTH _YEARBIRTH (All selects)


To be discussed.
